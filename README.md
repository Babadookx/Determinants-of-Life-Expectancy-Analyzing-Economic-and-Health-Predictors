# Determinants of Life Expectancy: Analyzing Economic and Health Predictors

## üìò Overview
This project explores **global life expectancy patterns** using World Health Organization (WHO) data.  
We evaluate both **economic** (GDP, income composition, schooling) and **health factors** (HIV/AIDS prevalence, child mortality, immunization coverage, etc.) to identify key predictors of life expectancy.  

The workflow combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **tree classification**, and **Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression** to understand complex variable relationships and improve prediction accuracy.

## üîç Key Highlights
- **Data-driven classification:** Tree model splits life expectancy into four quantile-based groups (Low, Below Average, Average, High).  
- **Key predictors:**  
  - HIV/AIDS prevalence, income composition of resources, and adult mortality are strong differentiators.  
- **PLS Regression:**  
  - Separate models for economic vs. disease-related factors.  
  - Disease-factor model slightly outperforms economic model (RMSE ‚âà 4.6 vs. 4.9 years).  
- **Interpretation:** Socioeconomic development and disease control are both critical to extending life expectancy globally.

## üß™ Methods
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  - Scatterplots, correlation matrices, boxplots by continent and development status.  
  - Quantile-based life expectancy grouping for clearer comparisons.
- **Tree Classification:**  
  - Built with `rpart` and `rpart.plot` for interpretability.  
  - Accuracy ‚âà 78.5% on test data.
- **PLS Regression Models:**  
  - Economic factors vs. disease-related factors modeled separately.  
  - Cross-validation used to select optimal components.  
  - Visualizations show clustering and prediction fit.
- **Visualization Libraries:** `ggplot2`, `ggcorrplot`, `kableExtra`.
